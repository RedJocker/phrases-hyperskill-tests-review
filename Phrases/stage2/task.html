<h2>Description </h2>

<p>To see the phrases that we have added to the application, we need to print them somewhere on the screen. In this stage, you will set up the RecyclerView so that it shows the list of the phrases on your Activity screen.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Create a XML layout for your RecyclerView items. The view should contain a <code>TextView</code> with a phrase <em>(ID: phraseTextView)</em> and a "Delete" <code>TextView</code> to remove it <em>(ID: deleteTextView)</em>. Your design still can be whatever you want, but keep these two Views with the ID's mentioned earlier.</li>
    <li>Create an adapter for your RecyclerView. Adapter should show the list with your predefined phrases. Set an <code>OnClickListener</code> for the "Delete" <code>TextView</code> which removes the item. It's not important in this step to save the user's actions in any way, so it's okay if after app restart all the deleted phrases are coming back.</li>
    <li>You should show at least 3 phrases on the screen in this stage.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>
